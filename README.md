Purpose of Punchout
==================================

**The Punchout Controls** are a set of javascript user interface controls for Knockout (MVVM) library for Javascript. Punchout is currently up-to-date with Knockout 1.3.

Controls Currently Under Development
---------------------
**poGrid** - A fully HTML true Knockout control with both server side and client side paging, sorting, and more. We are just getting under way. There is a sample in the Examples folder (in the Non-EntitySpaces folder)

Two Types of Controls
---------------------

1. Generic Punchout controls
2. EntitySpaces Punchout controls

The [EntitySpaces](http://www.entityspaces.net/) versions of the Punchout Controls will take the "Generic Punchout Controls" and build in support for the EntitySpaces architecture with all its row and dirty column state tracking capabilities, its built in paging capabilities, and so on.

Further Information
---------------------

EntitySpaces, LLC will be contributing much to this library, however, we will be enlisting others as well.
