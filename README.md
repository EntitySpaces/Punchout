Purpose of Punchout
==================================

**The Punchout Controls** are a set of javascript user interface controls for Knockout (MVVM) library for Javascript. Punchout is currently up-to-date with Knockout 1.3.

Controls Currently Under Development
---------------------
**poGrid** - A fully HTML true Knockout control with both server side and client side paging, sorting, and more. We are just getting under way. There is a sample in the Examples folder (in the Non-EntitySpaces folder)

Two Types of Controls
---------------------
![Punchout Design Goals](http://www.entityspaces.net/blog/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/4c131d011ab1_EE97/architecture_2.png)

1. Generic Punchout controls
2. EntitySpaces Punchout controls

The [EntitySpaces](http://www.entityspaces.net/blog/2011/12/05/Announcing+The+EntitySpaces+Punchout+Early+Adopters+Program.aspx) controls will work with and without EntitySpaces. The EntitySpaces javascript file tracks row and dirty column level changes just as does EntitySpaces in the .NET Framework.

Further Information
---------------------

EntitySpaces, LLC will be contributing much to this library, however, we will be enlisting others as well.
