Purpose of this Javascript Library
==================================

The **Punchout** Controls are a set of user interface controls for Knockout (MVVM) library for Javascript. The Punchout Controls will come in two forms. 

Controls Under Development
---------------------
**poGrid** - A fully HTML true Knockout control with paging - just getting under way. There is a sample in the Examples folder (in the Non-EntitySpaces folder)

Two Types of Controls
---------------------

1. Generic Knockout controls
2. EntitySpaces Knockout controls

The EntitysSpaces version of the knockout controls will work well with the EntitySpaces architecture with all it's row and dirty column state tracking capabilities.

Further Information
